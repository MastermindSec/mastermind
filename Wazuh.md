# Enterprise SOC Simulation: Demonstrating Advanced Cybersecurity Skills

## Project Overview

This project showcases my ability to design, implement, and manage a comprehensive Security Operations Center (SOC) environment. By simulating an enterprise-grade SOC, I've demonstrated proficiency in critical cybersecurity tools and methodologies essential for modern threat detection and response.

## Key Achievements

- **End-to-End SOC Implementation**: Successfully architected and deployed a fully functional SOC, integrating SIEM, SOAR, and case management systems.
- **Cloud Infrastructure Expertise**: Leveraged Digital Ocean to host critical components, showcasing cloud deployment skills.
- **Advanced Threat Detection**: Developed custom detection rules for sophisticated attack techniques, including Mimikatz credential dumping.
- **Automated Incident Response**: Designed and implemented SOAR workflows for efficient threat mitigation and analyst notification.
- **MITRE ATT&CK Integration**: Mapped detected threats to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, demonstrating a deep understanding of threat landscapes.

## Technical Proficiencies Demonstrated

- **SIEM/XDR**: Wazuh
- **SOAR**: Shuffle
- **Case Management**: TheHive
- **Endpoint Monitoring**: Sysmon on Windows 10
- **Threat Intelligence**: VirusTotal API integration
- **Cloud Platforms**: Digital Ocean
- **Operating Systems**: Windows 10, Ubuntu

## Project Architecture

This diagram illustrates the sophisticated architecture I designed, showcasing my ability to create complex, integrated security systems.

## Highlight: Custom Threat Detection

I developed a bespoke detection rule for Mimikatz, a tool frequently used by threat actors. This rule successfully identified the threat even when obfuscation techniques were employed:

This demonstrates my capability to create robust, evasion-resistant detection mechanisms.

## Automated Workflow and Incident Response

Leveraging Shuffle, I created an automated workflow that:
1. Captures Wazuh alerts
2. Enriches threat data using VirusTotal
3. Creates cases in TheHive
4. Notifies SOC analysts via email
